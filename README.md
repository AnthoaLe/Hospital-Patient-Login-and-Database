# Hospital Patient Login and Database

Mock hospital login page and patient data form and viewer. Hosted online as an interactable demo. Utilizes Bootstrap 5 for the front end, with the backend written in Javascript and managed by Firebase. Uses Firebase Authentication to verify sign ins and sign ups. User information is stored in Firebase Firestore and is sent and recieved on separate pages, with calls to verify the user is logged in at each step.

## Interactable Demo

The project is made as an interactable demo. You can use the following link to access it:
- [Hospital Patient Login and Database](https://anhoale-hospital-website.web.app/)

You'll be prompted with a page asking you to log in. If you do not have an account you can switch to the register tab and create an account. The user information is sent by Javascript, then handled and stored by Firebase Authentication in the backend.

After logging in, you'll be sent to a new page to enter some additional patient information. 

After submitting, you'll be redirected to another page where you can view the submitted information.
